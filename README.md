# Air-bnb-like-UI
My attempt to make a UI to resemble that of the air bnb  app
I have tried replicating the UI of the air bnb app on android.
Their app has smooth scrolling for viewing listed properties, and tapping on an image
seems to open a new activity without reloding the image. I couldn't keep the image from 
reloading, but I have managed to create that illusion by placing the image exactly at the 
same place as it was on the original home page, 
and I removed the animation associated with the change of activity.
